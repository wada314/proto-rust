# Builders and SingleField structs

puroro also generates a set of structs which is postfixed by "SingleField***N***"
(***N*** is the number of the field), which stores only a certain field.
You normally don't need to directly use these structs, but instead you can use
the `Builder` struct which is also generated by puroro to compose a struct:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
message MyMessage {
    int32 my_number = 1;
    repeated string my_name = 2;
    MyMessage my_child = 3;
}
```

```rust
# use ::std::ops::Deref;
# trait MyMessageTrait {}
pub struct MyMessageBuilder<T>(T);
impl MyMessageBuilder<()> {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
#       todo!()
        /* ... */
    }
}
impl<T: MyMessageTrait> MyMessageBuilder<T> {
    pub fn build(self) -> T {
#       todo!()
        /* ... */
    }

    pub fn append_my_number(self, value: i32)
    -> MyMessageBuilder<(T, MyMessageSingleField1)> {
#       todo!()
        /* ... */
    }
    pub fn append_my_name<U, V>(self, value: U)
    -> MyMessageBuilder<(T, MyMessageSingleField2<U, V>)>
    where
        for<'a> &'a U: IntoIterator<Item=&'a V>,
        V: AsRef<str>,
    {
#       todo!()
        /* ... */
    }
    pub fn append_my_child<U: MyMessageTrait>(self, value: U)
    -> MyMessageBuilder<(T, MyMessageSingleField3<U>)> {
#       todo!()
        /* ... */
    }
}

pub struct MyMessageSingleField1 {
    /* ... */
}
pub struct MyMessageSingleField2<T, U> {
    /* ... */
#     dummy: (T, U),
}
pub struct MyMessageSingleField3<T> {
    /* ... */
#     dummy: T,
}
```

Usage:

```ignored
let my_message = MyMessageBuilder::new()
    .append_my_number(10)
    .append_my_name(vec!["foo", "bar"])
    .build();
assert_eq!(10, my_message.my_number());
```

The biggest benefit of this builder is that the generated message only
consumes the memory for existing fields.
Even if you have a message which have 100 `int32` fields, if you use
this builder and set only 1 field, then the generated
struct only consumes as same memory size as an 1 field struct.

# Field types

For every fields (including the fields of nested oneof fields),
a method `append_<fieldname>` is generated for the builder struct.
The parameter types that these `append_*` methods can take are:

| base protobuf type  | non-`repeated` field | `repeated`  |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| `int32`             | `i32`                | (see below) |
| (any numeric types) | `T`                  | (see below) |
| `bytes`             | `impl AsRef<[u8]>`   | (see below) |
| `string`            | `impl AsRef<str>`    | (see below) |
| `SomeMessage`       | `impl SomeMessageTrait`|(see below)|

For repeated fields, a type `RepeatedType` where:

`for <'a> &'a RepeatedType: IntoIterator<Item=&'a ScalarType>`

can be passed. For example, `Vec<T>` or `&[T]` can be passed.

# Limitations
You may feel strange that the methods are named as `append_something`, not `set_something`.
This is because that our builder methods have some limitations:

- For non-message && (`optional` || `required`) fields, you cannot "clear"
the field once you have set some value. You can only overwrite it.
- Same for message non-repeated fields, you cannot "clear" the existing field
but you can only merge into the existing field.
- For non-message proto3 unlabeled fields, you cannot set the field value to
a default value (e.g. `0` for int32, `""` for string) once you have set a value.
- For repeated fields, you can only append the items. You cannot remove any
items from the existing field.

These limitations come from the protobuf language spec and our implementation
of builder structs. Our builder's append methods works as appending a serilized
field into a serialized message.

In the protocol buffer's specification, it is legal that the same field appears
several times in the serialized bytes array and the behavior for that is well
defined (as the above limitations).

# Samples
File [`tests/src/cases/builder.rs`](https://github.com/wada314/puroro/blob/master/tests/src/cases/builder.rs)
contains some test cases against `tests-pb/protos/full-coverage3.proto` .
